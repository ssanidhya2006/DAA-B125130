/*
Algorithm:
1. Create a 2D array dp of size n x n to store the minimum number of multiplications 
   needed to multiply the matrices from i to j.
2. Initialize dp[i][i] = 0 for all i, since multiplying one matrix requires no multiplications.
3. For each length of the chain from 2 to n, calculate the minimum number of 
   multiplications needed to multiply the matrices from i to j by trying all possible positions
   to split the product.
4. Return dp[1][n-1], which contains the minimum number of multiplications needed to 
   multiply the entire chain of matrices.
*/

//Time Complexity: O(n^3) - We have three nested loops, each going up to n.

/*
Explanation of how it works:
1. The function matrixChainMultiplication takes an array p of dimensions and the number of matrices n.
2. It initializes a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of multiplications 
   needed to multiply the matrices from i to j.
3. It uses a nested loop to calculate the minimum number of multiplications needed for each possible
   chain length and starting index.
4. For each pair of matrices (i, j), it tries all possible positions k to split the product and 
   calculates the number of multiplications needed for that split.
5. It updates dp[i][j] with the minimum number of multiplications found for that pair of matrices.
6. Finally, it returns dp[1][n-1], which contains the minimum number of multiplications 
   needed to multiply the entire chain of matrices.
