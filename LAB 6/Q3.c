/*
Algorithm:
1. Create a 2D array dp of size (m+1) x (n+1) to store the length of the longest common subsequence for substrings X[0..i-1] and Y[0..j-1].
2. Initialize dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, since the longest common subsequence with an empty string is 0.
3. Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since the longest common subsequence with an empty string is 0.
4. For each character in X and Y:
   - If the characters are equal, then:
     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
   - Otherwise:
     dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
5. Return dp[m][n], which contains the length of the longest common subsequence.
